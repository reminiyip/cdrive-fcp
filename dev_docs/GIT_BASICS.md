#### Basic Flow

If you're not using any branching (i.e. you only work on master branch), you can follow the below simple and basic Git flow.

###### Step 0: install git

`brew install git`  
`git config --global user.name <your-name>`  
`git config --global user.email <your-email>`  

###### Step 1: clone a project from GitHub

`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git`  

###### Step 2: make some changes

...

###### Step 3: saving changes

`git status`                                # show which files are modified  

`git add <file/dir>`                        # tells Git you wanna include updates to a particular file in the next commit  
                                            # (i.e. put them in staging area)  
OR `git add -A`                             # you wanna include ALL updates in the next commit  

`git commit -m <message>`                   # actually commits what you added to the staging area
                                            # please include a concise commit message

###### Step 4: get updates from remote

`git pull origin master`                    # before you push it to the remote repo, pull down the latest version first.
                                            # Git will try to merge them, but you need to resolve any conflicts introduced manually  

###### Step 4b: get updates from other repo (i.e. repos other than your own forked one)

`git remote -v`                             # show what remote names you have, usually you'll have an 'origin' remote repo  
                                            # that's where you cloned your repo from in Step 1  

`git remote add <remote-name> <repo-url>`   # add a remote repo, usually from the repo you forked from
                                            # usually name it 'upstream'  

`git pull <remote-name> master`  

###### Step 4c: resolve conflicts (if any)

Git tells you which files are having conflicts like this:  

```
...
Auto-merging <file>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
...
```

Open that file, you'll see:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
<your version of code>
=======
<remote version code>
>>>>>>> branch-a
```

Decide what to keep and remove all other stuffs. Then commit again.  

`git add -A`  
`git commit -m <message>`  

###### Step 5: push commits to remote

`git push origin master`                    # push to the master branch

###### Step 6: make a pull request

If you're remote repo is a forked one, and you would like to request the original repo to merge your changes, goto GitHub and press the button "New Pull Request". This will send the pull request to the original repo, and the authorized users can decide whether to merge your changes, or abort.
